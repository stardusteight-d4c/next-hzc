# HZC | Single Page Application



> A Single Page Application built with Next.js and React. By default, Next.js pre-renders each page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance,
> instead of doing everything via client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.
